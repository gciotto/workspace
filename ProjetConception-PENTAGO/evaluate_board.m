%% FUNCTION evaluate_board
%  This function gives points for a board according to its configuration.
%  Each line/column/diagonal with 5 filled positions gives 100000, with 4,
%  10000, with 3, 1000 and with 2, 100. Filled positions with no neighbors
%  receive no points. Positions which cannot be turned ( (2,2), (2,5),
%  (5,2) and (5,5) ) receive 100 points.
%  Parameters:  state_matrix is the matrix representating the state of the
%               game and player is the player which the pontuation will be
%               given for.
%  It returns the earned points and a matrix which can used to test the
%  program.

% Each element of hasBeenDetected is an integer whose representation in
% binary determines if that element has already been detected taking
% place in at least one line/column or diagonal. 0001 means that it takes place in
% a COLUMN, 0010 in a LINE, 0100 in a DIAGONAL to the right and 1000 in a
% DIAGONAL to the left. For example, if hasBeenDetected(i, j) is 0011, it
% means that position forms a LINE AND a COLUMN at the same time.

% playerScores is an array that stores the scores of all combination the 
% playerâ€™s got so far in each one of the possible configurations (COLUMN, LINE 
% and DIAGONALS). For example, if the player has a 3-element line, then 
% playerScores(2,1) receives the score for that combination.
