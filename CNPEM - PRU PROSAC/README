PROSAC PRU Interrupter 

Author: Gustavo CIOTTO PINTON


Each time a new synchronism pulse, the firmware running in the PRU launches an interruption to the user-space program. 
It was designed to wake up PROSAC interrupter thread only in the case it was necessary, discarding the explicit call of yield()
a lot of times.

It is provided as well a test program, pru_prosac_loader_with_threads.c, containing 1 thread which is waken up by the PRU module and
shares the CPU with other 100 threads.

Building and launching scripts are also provided.

* Requirements *

1) PRU driver and library

1) Run build_overlay.sh to configure PRU pins
