	<h3 class = "section_title">EA072 - Artificial Intelligence in Industrial Applications</h3>
	
	<h3 class = "text">The first exercise covers two fundamental features in Artifical Intelligence: variable selection by filters and methods called wrappers and neural networks (MLP and ELM). The report can be accessed through this <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/raw/master/UNICAMP%20-%20EA072%20-%20EFC1/EFC1_CIOTTO_PINTON.pdf" target="_blank">link</a> and the source code in directories <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/tree/master/UNICAMP%20-%20EA072%20-%20EFC1/selecao_variaveis" target="_blank">variable selection</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/tree/master/UNICAMP%20-%20EA072%20-%20EFC1/predicao" target="_blank">neural networks</a>.

	<h3 class = "text">The activity developed during this course consisted on a library manager system, capable of managing book loans and registering users. We used Java language and explored many design patterns during the system's development. The source code can be accessed at this <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/tree/master/UNICAMP%20-%20MC302/sistemadebiblioteca" target="_blank">directory</a>.</h3>

	<h3 class = "section_title">MC404 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language</h3>
	
	<h3 class = "text">Personally, this is the course I enjoyed the most during my years at UNICAMP. The ARM architecture was adopted during this course, so all exercises were developed using the ARM instruction set. You are going to find in this <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/tree/master/UNICAMP%20-%20MC404" target="_blank">directory</a>, either short exercises or longer projects, which are evidently more important. Concerning the projects:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		  <li><a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/tree/master/UNICAMP%20-%20MC404/Trab01" >Project 1 - IAS Assembler</a>: we wrote in C a program which received two files as parameters: the first contains the a porgram written in ARM and the second is the output file containing the hexadecimal codes related to the instructions. The file containing the main functions in the project can be viewed at this <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/blob/master/UNICAMP%20-%20MC404/Trab01/montador_ias.c" target="_blank">link</a>.</li>
		  <li><a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/tree/master/UNICAMP%20-%20MC404/Trabalho02" >Project 2 - scanf and printf</a>: the objective of this project was to implement in ARM language the functions scanf and printf available in C library stdio.h. The results can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/blob/master/UNICAMP%20-%20MC404/Trabalho02/myscanf.s" target="_blank">myscanf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/blob/master/UNICAMP%20-%20MC404/Trabalho02/myprintf.s" target="_blank">myprintf</a>.</li>
		  <li><a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/tree/master/UNICAMP%20-%20MC404/Trabalho03">Project 3 - simple os</a>: he objective of this project was to program a simple OS, capable of initializing new process (fork() function), switching between process contexts, enabling interruptions etc. The main source code directory can be accessed at this <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/tree/master/UNICAMP%20-%20MC404/Trabalho03" target="_blank">link</a>.</li>

	<h3 class = "section_title">EA532 - Applied Electronics</h3>

	<h3 class = "text">Four exercises were developed during the teaching of this course. Those exercises consisted on simulations realized using  <a href="http://www.orcad.com/products/orcad-pspice-designer/overview" target="_blank">PSpice</a>.
	
	<br><br> The reports, all written in Portuguese, are listed below:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		  <li><a href="https://github.com/gciotto/workspace/raw/master/UNICAMP%20-%20EA532%20-%20Atividade%201/document.pdf" >Activity no. 1</a></li>

	<h3 class = "text">The project realized during this course consisted on a system capable of searching a database containing many figures. The user could choose between searching by writing tags relative to the images or by uploading a similar image into the system. The project was programmed in PHP and C++ and we used a MySQL server.
