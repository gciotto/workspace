Currently in the ninth semester of the computer engineering course at
\textit{University of Campinas UNICAMP}, I am looking for an internship related
to the areas of embedded systems or information technology with  a duration of
between 6 and 12 months in France or Germany, starting from January 2016. The
opportunity of building an international career has always been one of my most
relevant objectives considering my academic choices and, for this reason, an
internship at Airbus means a great step forward in my career. In this
way, since my admission at UNICAMP, I have been dedicating myself as much as possible to every
discipline taught during these last years. As a consequence of those
efforts, I have succeed in achieving a great academic performance, verified by
the high class rank I presently have. This qualification allowed me to apply
for, and subsequently to be selected for, a double degree program at
\textit{École Supérieure d'Electricité SUPELEC}, where I spent the last two
years studying electrical and computer engineering.

Having fulfilled my first international academic experience, the requirement of
developing an activity in an engineering company became indispensable to my
professional growth. It is in this context that an internship at Airbus, a
leading enterprise in the aircraft market and one of the main actors in
engineering, represents a unique opportunity to improve all concepts acquired
so far through contact with key techniques used in large complex systems
nowadays.  One of the essential points consists in the fact that Airbus employs
many highly qualified employees who undoubtedly would help me a lot through
the exchange of experiences and acquisition of an effective and wide
network. In addition  to these features, Airbus constantly encourages
the process of innovation, allowing its workers to put forward their ideas and
suggestions, making the working environment much more pleasant and open to the
conception of new intelligent solutions. 



With regard to my competences,  I believe the understanding of the concepts involving programming is the most pertinent to this internship. During my time in all the academic institutions where I studied and enterprises I worked for, both in France and Brazil, I had close contact with many programming languages and algorithms. At UNICAMP, I was assigned to perform twice the function of laboratory assistant in two disciplines taught in the computer engineering course: in the first discipline, I assisted the students during the lab sessions, developed in C language, whose purpose was to explore concepts such as arrays, sorting and search algorithms, recursion and pointers, and in the second, the lab sessions explored some features of an ARM board, such as interruptions, converters and serial transmission. Besides, during my first professional experience, I was responsible to maintain the company's database (MySQL Server) and web systems (written in PHP and JavaScript). Another key aspect is the capacity of communicating with other team members in many languages, since Airbus is composed of a multicultural staff. During my stay in France, I have achieved great results in the language certification exams that I took, such as TOELF ITP and TCF, proving that I am able to work in multilingual environments. 

Thank you for your time and effort taken when reviewing my application. I am
looking forward to your answer.

Revisei minha carta conforme pedido. Retirei algumas frases que julguei não ter tanta inmportancia e adicionei algumas informações sobre minhas experiencias professionais. O unico problema e o tamanho: as insercoes compensaram as retiradas e o tamanho continuou parecido com o tamanho da versao anterior.
