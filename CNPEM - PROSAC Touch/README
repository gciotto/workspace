PROSAC Touch Client

Author: Gustavo CIOTTO PINTON

Application developed for the STM32F7 discovery kit which uses a provided HAL library, the FreeRTOS operating system and the STMCubeMX for pin configuration.

The header file stm32f7xx_hal_conf.h generated byCubeMX app had misleading definitions of the PHY registers. It was configured to use another chip, so I needed to update with the right register addresses. 

* Requirements *

1) GCC arm cross-compiler
2) OpenOCD to load binary into the board

* Running *

1) Eclipse project has been configured to load and start application automatically. In case of failure, open the tab 'Run configurations' and check the paths.
