## PROSAC Touch Client

### Author

Gustavo CIOTTO PINTON

### Description

Application developed for the STM32F7 discovery kit which uses a provided HAL library, the FreeRTOS operating system and the STMCubeMX for pin configuration.

The header file `stm32f7xx_hal_conf.h` generated byCubeMX app had misleading definitions of the PHY registers. It was configured to use another chip, so I needed to update with the right register addresses. 

### Requirements

1. GCC arm cross-compiler
2. OpenOCD to load binary into the board

### Running

A tutorial explaining how to configure Eclipse with OpenOCD and GCC Arm is available [here](http://www.carminenoviello.com/2015/07/13/started-stm32f746g-disco/).

1. Eclipse project has been configured to load and start application automatically. In case of failure, open the tab 'Run configurations' and check the paths.
