    Client module is responsible to start the application. Basically, it creates two threads: 
    * the first one instantiates a CommandWindow object and opens it. 
    * the second one uses the Requester object from the CommandWindow object to send reading commands
      periodically. By default, the period was defined to 100 ms.
      
    Dependencies : python-qt4, install with 'sudo apt-get install python-qt4'
