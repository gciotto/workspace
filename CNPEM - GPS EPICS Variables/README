Version/Date: 1.0 - 25/07/2016

The project provides a Python module that requests information from the NTP server and GPS receiver and makes them available across network through EPICS variables.
OPI interfaces capable of reading those PVs are also included.

* Requirements *

1) Python module requires pcaspy, ntplib and gps modules.
2) CSS is required to open the interfaces.

* Running *

1) Python PV server: edit GPS-PV-Server.py with correct IP address and variable prefix of the server.
2) OPI interfaces: open CSS and run Host-selection.opi. Include or remove buttons and macros, depending on how many servers are available.
