\textbf{Subject:} 6 to 12 - month internship in France or Germany at Airbus
Innovation Group

\vspace{12pt} 

To whom it may concern, 

\vspace{12pt}
%======== LETTRE ===============%
Currently in the ninth semester of the computer engineering course at
\textit{University of Campinas UNICAMP}, I am looking for an internship related
to the areas of embedded systems and information technology with duration
between 6 and 12 months in France or Germany, starting from January 2016. The
opportunity of building an international career has always been one of my most
relevant objectives considering my academic choices and, for this reason, an
internship at Airbus means a great step forward to me. In this way, since my
admission at UNICAMP, I have been dedicating myself as much as possible to every
discipline taught during these last years. It is with this same devotion that I
intend to meet the requirements presented by Airbus. As a consequence of those
efforts, I have succeed in achieving a great academic performance, verified by
the high class rank I presently have. This qualification allowed me to apply
for, and subsequently to be selected for, a double degree program at
\textit{École Supérieure d'Electricité SUPELEC}, where I spent the last two
years studying. There, I was able to improve my oral skills in both French and English and
equally the concepts taught in the engineering courses, which are highly
important for this internship, such as signal processing, control,
electrotechnics and computing.

Having fulfilled my first international academic experience, the requirement of
developing an activity in an engineering company became indispensable to my
professional growth. It is in this context that an internship at Airbus, a
leading enterprise in the aircraft market and one the main actors in
engineering, represents a unique opportunity to improve all concepts acquired
so far through contact with key techniques used in large complex systems
nowadays.  One of the essential points consists in the fact that Airbus employs
many highly qualified employees who undoubtedly would help me a lot through
the exchange of experiences and acquisition of an effective and wide
network. In addition  to these features, Airbus constantly encourages
the process of innovation, allowing its workers to put forward their ideas and
suggestions, making the working environment much more pleasant and open to the
conception of new intelligent solutions. Based on the experiences acquired
during my two years of exchange, I consider myself able to meet the challenges
posed by this internship, as I have always devoted my best to achieve the
proposed objectives and tasks as clearly and efficiently as possible, even with
many potential obstacles, such as a foreign language.


\vspace{12pt}

With regard to my competences,  I believe the understanding of the concepts
involving programming is the most pertinent to this internship. During my time
in all the academic institutions where I studied, both in France and Brazil, I
had close contact with many programming languages and algorithms, allowing me to perform
twice the function of laboratory assistant of two fundamental disciplines taught
in the computer engineering course at UNICAMP. For this reason, I can certainly
say I am prepared to perform the tasks assigned to me during the internship.
Another key aspect which is required in this internship is the capacity of
communicating with other team members in many languages, since Airbus is
composed of a multicultural staff. During my stay in France, I have achieved
results in the language certification exams that I took, proving
that I am able to work in multilingual environments. Thirdly, but not less
important, there is the commitment to results and quality. This competence is very important given
the competitive scope of the sector,  in which each existing alternative  in a
project must be exhaustively analyzed in order to find the best one.

Thank you for your time and effort taken when reviewing my application. I am
looking forward to your answer.
