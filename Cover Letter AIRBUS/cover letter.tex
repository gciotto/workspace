Currently in the ninth semester of the Computer Engineering at
\textit{Universidade Estadual de Campinas - UNICAMP}, I am looking for an
internship related to the areas of embedded systems and information technology
with duration between 6 and 12 months in France, starting from January 2016. The opportunity of
building an international career has always been one of my most relevant
objectives considering my academic choices and professional project. In this
way, since my admission in computer engineer course at UNICAMP, I have been
dedicating myself as maximum as I can to every discipline taught during these
last years and, consequently, I succeed in achieving a great academic
performance, verified by the high class rank I presently have: I am the second
best ranked student out of 97 enrolled in my promotion. This qualification
allowed me to apply for, and be selected afterwards, a double degree program
between UNICAMP and \textit{École Supérieure d'Electricité - SUPELEC}, one of
the main institutions of electrical and computer engineering in France. At this
occasion, I faced a strong and qualified competition, since only students
having the best grades in the whole school are allowed to join the selection
process. Thus, I spent the last two years studying in Paris, where I could
improve my oral skills in both French and English and equally the concepts
taught in the engineering courses, such as signal processing, control,
electrotechnics and computing, for which I have always been among the best ones
in the class.

Once fulfilled my first international academic experience, the requirement of
developing an activity in a engineering company became indispensable to my
professional growth. It is in this context that an internship at Airbus, a
leading enterprise in the aircraft market and one the main actors in
engineering, represents a single opportunity of improving all concepts acquired
so far through the contact with key techniques used in large complex systems
nowadays.  One of the essential points consists in the fact that Airbus employs
many highly qualified employees who undoubtedly would help me a lot through
experience exchanging and acquisition of an effective and wide networking. In
addition  to these features, Airbus constantly encourages innovation process,
allowing its workers to have complete freedom to expose their ideas and
suggestions, making working environment much more pleasant and prepared to
conceive new intelligent solutions. Based on the experiences acquired during my
two years of exchange, I consider myself able of meeting the challenges posed by
this internship, once I have always devoted my best to achieve the proposed
objectives and tasks as clearly and efficiently as possible, even with many
eventual obstacles, such as the foreign language.

Thank you for any time and effort you take when reviewing my application. I am
looking forward to your answer.
