The clients provides a graphical interface to monitor and send commands to the single-board computers present in the UVX's control network.

It was written in Python and is basically composed of 3 threads, which are listed below:

1) Interface thread, which handles events and signals of the GUI;
2) Monitor thread, which periodically enqueues READ commands to the SBCs;
3) Consumer thread, which dequeues commands and send them via a TCP interface. Besides, this thread also sends other Linux commands, such as 'ls -l', through a SSH connection.
