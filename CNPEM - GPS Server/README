GPS - NTP building scripts

Author: Gustavo CIOTTO PINTON
Version/Date: 1.0 - 25/07/2016

The repository contains a set of scripts used to setup and initialize NTP and GPSd services in a BeagleBone board. It also contains
a device overlay file, which configures the required GPIO pins. Two versions are provided and use two different sets of pins.

The repository is composed of three types of files:

1) build_ntp*.sh: downloads, installs and configures the NTP server. The 'P9' suffix configures the host to capture PPS pulse from P9.12 pin. Otherwise, it uses P8.7 pin
2) *.service: systemd service files
3) overlay_GPS*.dts: pin configuration files. Two versions are provided , one for each possible pin configuration.

* Running *

1) Give running permissions to the script with 'chmod +x build_ntp_P9.sh'
2) Run with './build_ntp_P9.sh overlay_GPS_P9.dts'
